# Zoo-Programm
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. The program simulates an automated information booth for a small zoo.

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Zoo Programm.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net6.0".*

*Note: German language used.*
