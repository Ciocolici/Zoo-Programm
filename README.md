# Zoo-Programm
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. The program simulates an automated information booth for a small Zoo.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Zoo Programm.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net6.0".*
